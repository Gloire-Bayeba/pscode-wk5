// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

Input a number 
 IF number  modulo 2 equals 0, then 
    display "even"
 Else 
       display "odd"

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

Enter 5 numbers 

calculate average as sum of 5 numbers divided by 5

 IF (n1 < n2)
      set max to n2
Else 
       set max to n1
IF (n3 > max)
     set max to n3
IF (n4 > max)
     set max to n4
IF (n5 > max)
     set max to n5

IF (n1 > n2)
    set min to n2
Else 
    set min to n1
If (n3 < min) 
    set min to n3
If (n4 < min) 
     set min to n4
If (n5 < min )
    set min to n5

Display " The average of the five number is :", average
Display " The smallest number is :" , minimum
Display "The largest number is:" , maximum
